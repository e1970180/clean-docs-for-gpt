## User- or browser-dependent settings, general settings

### User- or browser-dependent settings

Some of the frontend settings depend on the user. Other settings can be set by client. This allows you for example to have different languages per user, and a different theme depending on the device that is used to display Home Assistant.

To change these settings, in the bottom left, select your username to open your {% my profile title="**User profile**" %}.

- To change general settings such as language, number and time format, go to the **User settings**.
- To change browser dependent settings such as the theme, default dashboard, or whether or not to show the sidebar, change the **Browser settings**.

### Themes

Themes can be set per browser. In the {% my profile title="**User profile**" %}, you can define some theme settings, such as whether you want a light or dark theme. However, more detailed theme settings require YAML configuration. Refer to the documentation of the frontend integration.

### General settings

Some of the settings, such as location and currency, were defined during the onboarding process. They can be changed under {% my general title="**Settings** > **System** > **General**" %}. Refer to the documentation on setup basic information.
