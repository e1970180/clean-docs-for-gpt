Gain insight into your energy production by integrating your solar panels into Home Assistant.

If you also set up the Solar Forecast integration, you will be able to see expected solar production and automate based on planned production.



## Hardware

Home Assistant will need to know the amount of energy that is being produced. This can be done in various ways.

### Using a CT clamp sensor

{% include energy/ct_clamp.md %}

### Connecting to your inverter

Some solar inverters have APIs that can be read by Home Assistant.
